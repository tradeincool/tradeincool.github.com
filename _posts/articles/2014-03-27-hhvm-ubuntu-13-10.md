## Quick installation guide

Here are some quick notes on how to install hhvm on Ubuntu 13.10.

Lets get apache2 running on here:

```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2
a2enmod proxy proxy_fcgi
service apache2 restart
```

To install prebuilt packages for Ubuntu 13.10 (amd64):

```
wget -O - http://dl.hhvm.com/conf/hhvm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb http://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu saucy main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hhvm.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install hhvm
sudo apt-get install hhvm-fastcgi
```

To test if its working, lets add an info file.

```
vi /var/www/info.php
```

Put the following in there:

```
<?php $phpinfo(); ?
```

To save the file issue:

```
:wq
```

Now go and check your site at http://youripaddress/info.php
It should work.  Some useful additional file locations:

```
/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/hhvm_proxy_fcgi.conf
```

This file should have the following line:

```
ProxyPass / fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/var/www/
```

You may need to update your 000-default.conf file as well, adding the following line:

```
ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*\.php(/.*)?)$ fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/var/www/$1
```

Issue a restart on this:

```
service apache2 restart
```
