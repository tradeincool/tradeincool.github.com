## Quick installation guide

Here are some quick notes on how to install hhvm on Ubuntu 13.10.

To install prebuilt packages for Ubuntu 13.10 (amd64):

> wget -O - http://dl.hhvm.com/conf/hhvm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb http://dl.hhvm.com/ubuntu saucy main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hhvm.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install hhvm
sudo apt-get install hhvm-fastcgi

I'm 100% sure, but you may need to also run:

> a2enmod proxy proxy_fcgi
service apache2 restart

To test if its working, lets add an info file.

> vi /var/www/info.php

Put the following in there:

> <?php $phpinfo(); ?

To save the file issue:

> :wq
