## Upcoming Cloud Maintenance

We want to notify you of an upcoming maintenance on the networking infrastructure of our Next Gen Cloud Servers product in our DFW Datacenters. This maintenance event does not require any action on your behalf. Please note the following dates and times associated with this maintenance:

DFW Datacenter- June 26th from 12:01 AM to 4:00 AM CDT

As a result of this maintenance, your Next Gen Cloud Servers network connectivity could be interrupted one or more times for a period ranging from seconds up to 10 minutes. The large time window is in place to get through the entire infrastructure.  This brief networking interruption will affect all Next Gen Cloud Servers within these regions. This includes connectivity from Cloud Servers to the Cloud Load Balancers, Cloud Networking, Cloud Block Storage services as well as private server-to-server connectivity.

Additional information will be made available via our status page during and after the maintenance event at http://status.rackspace.com.

This maintenance is vital to expand the capabilities and improve the performance and reliability of our core network and Cloud Networks offering.  Furthermore it will reduce the need for such interruptions for future upgrades.  We always strive to have no-downtime deploys of upgrades, but some require small delays in network traffic while the process completes.  We only perform them after extensive testing and planning to ensure minimal impact.
