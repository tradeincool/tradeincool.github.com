We perform maintenance to continue to deliver optimal performance, reliability and security. We strive to perform them without impact to our customers; however, the possibility always exists that a maintenance event can have unintended consequences up to and including unplanned or extended service interruption. We hope you understand that such maintenances are necessary to benefit you and your customers.

If we expect a maintenance event to cause service disruption we will use reasonable efforts to post advance notice of the maintenance. For example, if we have to remove a system element to perform maintenance, we will transfer the system to a redundant element to minimize downtime, but there may be some downtime while the system transfers to the redundant element.

If maintenance is urgently needed, we may not be able to give much, or any, advance notice; for example, we may need to install critical security updates or replace failed system components.
